New Life Cycle Methods:

getDerivedStateFromProps(nextProps, prevState)
	 static function *** No access to this 
	 replacing componentWillRecieveProps
	 The function is used when a component is updated but also when it is mounted, right after the constructor was called, so you no longer need to use constructor or class property form of state if you want to set initial state from props.

getSnapshotBeforeUpdate(prevProps, prevState)
	It is usable mostly if you need to read the current DOM state
